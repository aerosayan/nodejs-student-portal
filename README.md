#### LICENSE : DEFAULT , for now; will change to GPL V 2.0 soon.



#### Status  : This is one of my oldest work, and I have already forgotten most of nodejs, but obviously can re-learn in a few days, if I need to build something amazing. Currently not in development since, I am currently focussed on something amazing !

Why am I sharing ?</br>
-> Nodejs tutorials while very illuminating, have a very steep learning curve. Thus I am sharing this to give an example of an implementation of a basic user registration and management server using the MEAN stack. Also, I may need to come back to it to learn the basics of MEAN stack again. :) </br>

<h3> How to start the portal?</h3>
<ull>
<li> Install NODE.js from <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">https://nodejs.org/en/download/</a></li>
<li> Install mongoDB from
<a href="https://www.mongodb.org/downloads#production">https://www.mongodb.org/downloads</a></li>
<li> <u> If you want to do administration stuff with the mongoDB database</u><br>
<ul>
    <li> Start the MongoDB server by typing <code>mongod</code> in the terminal</li>
    <li> For performing database operations start mongo shell using <code>mongo</code></li>
